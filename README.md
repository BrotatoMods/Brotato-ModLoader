# Brotato-ModLoader

## This repo is out of date, as Brotato now oficially includes ModLoader. Please do not use this repo or the files it provides. This repo is only preserved here for historical reasons, and may be removed completely in the future.

## Installation

### Install PCK

- Download the PCK from the [Releases](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-ModLoader/releases) page.
  - Find the *.pck* file under "Assets" for the latest release.
- Install the PCK like any other mod.
  - See the [Wiki's installation guides](https://brotato.wiki.spellsandguns.com/Modding#Mod_Installation) for help.

### Mods Setup

- Add a folder called `mods` to your game folder
- Download some mod ZIPs. Add them to the `mods` folder.
  - Mods come as zip files. They *don't* need to be unzipped, you can just put them right into the `mods` folder.
- Launch the game as usual.

See the main [BrotatoMods GitHub page](https://github.com/BrotatoMods) for the current list of compatible mods.

## Notes

### Help

You can get help on the [Space Potatoes Discord](https://discord.gg/j39jE6k), in the #modding-help channel. You need to visit #modding-faq, read the info, then click the emoji to gain access to the other modding channels.

### Roadmap

ModLoader is still in very active development. Eventually, downloading a custom PCK won't be necessary, and we will list all the mods on the wiki page.

### Creating Mods

See the [ModLoader Wiki](https://github.com/GodotModding/godot-mod-loader/wiki) for info.

There are also example mods here: [BrotatoMods/Brotato-Example-Mods](https://github.com/BrotatoMods/Brotato-Example-Mods).
